titanic_machine_learning_example
================================

A simple example of how to solve Kaggle's
"[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)"
challenge using Python and scikit-learn.

This simple example will get you about 78% accuracy. It shows you how to instantiate
and use various classifiers in scikit-learn.

Note: This example combines six different classifiers, just as example of
how to run and average multiple classifiers.  You can actually get a better
accuracy by being smarter about how to combine classifiers and which ones to use.
This just shows you the scikit-learn syntax.

This example also assumes you've already done a grid search and found the best
hyper parameters for your classifiers (especially the SVM). But if you aren't
sure how to do that, the scikit-learn docs have a
[good example](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/grid_search_digits.html#example-grid-search-digits-py)
that you can copy.
